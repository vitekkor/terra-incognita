At the beginning of the game, the Player is shown only the starting cell. 
The cell you try to go will automatically become visible.
There is a labyrinth. Table of symbols:
^
Your task is to move through the labyrinth in the dark (use the W, S, A, D keys to move through the maze), find the treasure in it, and then exit the labyrinth.
If you have reached the exit and the treasure has not yet been found, the player must continue searching for the treasure.
When you hit a hole, the player automatically jumps to the next hole by number, and if this hole is the last one, then to the first hole. The total number of holes is unknown.
You win by reaching the exit with the treasure, and lose by using up the limit of moves (moves that run into the wall do not count).
